### Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
- For my Final project of astronomy picture of the day, I started with the mockup.
- I came up with the simple color palette and fonts which make it easy for other to view.
- With today's submission, I am adding the basic pages of my website that viewer have a look.
### Midterm
- I started with html to create layout of the mockup I created.
- I created 3 pages 1 landing page, second one is the favourite page where I store the Images I like and last one is the information page of the Image(Astronomy Picture of the Day Search) I seleted.
- Then I start working on adding css and placing text and Images on their right place While doing that I suffer with the allignment issue for the go page So I created a different css page for it.
- At the end I suffer with adding a heart o card of go_page on which Astronomy Picture of the Day Search is shown.
- For this Assignment I just added html, css and a little css to heart icon on the go page and leaving the rest of the java script for the next time.
### final
- Working on the final stuff of this assignment I faced lot of difficulties as I have to merge my three pages on one using api which is the most difficult part.
- During this assignment I have to come up with lot of changes to my final assignment as I remove heart because letting it just make my UI bad at some point and it is not fitting with my content properly.
- I also have to change the place of favourite to middle on the index page as it make my page look good rather than letting it down.
- I also change the UI of my page at some point according to my needs.
- I added remove and add button so that I can add as many as Images I like and remove them whenever I want.
