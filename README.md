### Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
- For my Final project of astronomy picture of the day, I started with the mockup.
- I came up with the simple color palette and fonts which make it easy for other to view.
- With today's submission, I am adding the basic pages of my website that viewer have a look.
### Midterm
- I started with html to create layout of the mockup I created.
- I created 3 pages 1 landing page, second one is the favourite page where I store the Images I like and last one is the information page of the Image(Astronomy Picture of the Day Search) I seleted.
- Then I start working on adding css and placing text and Images on their right place While doing that I suffer with the allignment issue for the go page So I created a different css page for it.
- At the end I suffer with adding a heart o card of go_page on which Astronomy Picture of the Day Search is shown.
- For this Assignment I just added html, css and a little css to heart icon on the go page and leaving the rest of the java script for the next time.
